# n8n Workflow: Gmail Labels Categorizer

This workflow automates the categorization of Gmail emails by analyzing their content and applying relevant labels.

## Description

The workflow uses the Gmail Trigger to monitor for new emails.  It then employs an OpenAI Chat Model to classify the email text into predefined categories.  Finally, it uses the Gmail node to automatically apply the appropriate label to the email.

## Workflow Details

1.  **Gmail Trigger:** Triggers the workflow when a new email arrives in the specified Gmail account.
2.  **Agent Label:** Uses a Langchain Text Classifier with an OpenAI Chat Model to analyze the email text and categorize it.  The categories include:
    * Other
    * Mails clients
    * Newsletters
    * Services en ligne (outil, abonnement)
    * Sponsorship
    * Collaboration
3.  **Gmail Nodes (Sponsorship, Newsletter, Mail clients, Collaboration, Services en ligne):** These nodes apply the corresponding Gmail label based on the category determined by the Agent Label node.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Ensure you have n8n installed and a Gmail account.
2.  Import the `Gmail_Labels_Categorizer.json` file into your n8n instance.
3.  **Credentials:**
    * Configure the **Gmail Trigger** and **Gmail** nodes with your Gmail OAuth2 credentials.  You'll need to authorize n8n to access your Gmail account.
    * Configure the **OpenAI Chat Model** node with your OpenAI API credentials.
4.  **Label IDs:**
    * In each of the Gmail nodes (Sponsorship, Newsletter, etc.), you'll need to replace the placeholder `labelIds` with the actual IDs of your Gmail labels.  You can find these IDs in your Gmail settings.

## Usage

Once configured, the workflow will automatically run whenever a new email arrives in your inbox, categorizing and labeling it.

Important Notes:

Credentials: Pay very close attention to the credential setup in each workflow. Incorrect credentials will prevent the workflows from running.
Dependencies: Some workflows may rely on specific n8n nodes or other workflows. Make sure you have all necessary components installed.
Customization: These READMEs are based on the structure of your workflow files. You may need to further customize them with specific details about your use case or any modifications you've made.
Security: Be mindful of storing API keys and credentials securely. Avoid committing them directly to your repository. Consider using environment variables or secure configuration methods.
I hope this helps you create thorough and informative README files for your n8n workflows!
